# Project Proposal

Name: Chefit (chef-it)

Ever just stared at your refrigerator trying to figure out what to eat? You ever just stare at cooking ingredients trying to decide what to cook? Do you ever just want to eat something light and heavy in protein after a workout? This is where Chefit comes into play.

Chefit is a way for people who have troubles figuring out what to cook for their meals, or someone that is looking to track their nutrition intake, by giving you bunch of variety of foods that can be made with ingredients that they currently have. In that list of foods, it shows the recipe on how the food is prepared, the time it takes to prepare, and their nutritional values. Additionally, if one  wants to make something using specific ingredient, Chefit can also filter their list of food by showing all the food that can be made with the specific ingredients included. 

In order for Chefit to work, we would have to access the food database by calling their API(https://spoonacular.com/food-api/docs#Search-Recipes-by-Ingredients) to get a list of recipe with the food ingredients that you specified. Using the list of recipes, we can find out more about their nutritional facts with the list of ingredients in such recipes to cater to users needs. With the nutrition facts of the ingredients, users can also plan for their meals in the future by calculating certain factors like, amount of calories, sugar intake, protein consumptions, etc.
